# Github-Api-Endpoint
This Node.js CLI application interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve the repositories of a specified user. It prompts the user to input a GitHub username via the console, fetches the user's repositories from GitHub, and saves the repository names to a file named 'USERNAME.txt'.
## Requirements
- Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed in your environment.
- npm: The Node.js package manager, npm, is used to manage dependencies.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install the packages listed in package.json.


## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
my-node-cli
```
When prompted, enter the GitHub username whose repositories you want to fetch. The application will create a file named USERNAME.txt containing the repository names.
